# ChirpStack Simulator

**ChirpStack Simulator** is a C++ variant of the open-source simulator [ChirpStack Simulator](https://github.com/brocaar/chirpstack-simulator) developed by [brocaar](https://github.com/brocaar) and co. for the ChirpStack open-source LoRaWANÂ® Network-Server stack. By simulating real LoRa gateways and LoRa devices, **ChirpStack Simulator** allows ChirpStack users to check their setups, to debug failures and to have a thorough understanding of how ChirpStack really works in action.

## Building

### How to build
As for many C++ projects, **ChirpStack Simulator** can be built using the CMake build system. The minimum required version of CMake is 3.15. To build **ChirpStack Simulator**, use the following commands:

```bash
$ bash scripts/pre-build.sh
$ bash scripts/build.sh
```

The binary file will be located at `bin/chirpstack_simulator`.

### Note

* **About cryptopp**: Running the bash script `scripts/pre-build.sh` before building is required because **cryptopp** is not fully supporting CMake as of now.
* **About gRPC**: Installing and configuring **gRPC** can be fairly complicated. See also: [grpc-cpp](https://github.com/chungphb/grpc-cpp), [chirpstack-client](https://github.com/chungphb/chirpstack-client).

## Configuration

### How to generate a new configuration file

Having a valid TOML configuration file is mandatory to run **ChirpStack Simulator**. This configuration file could be generated using the `--generate-config-file` command-line option:

```bash
./bin/chirpstack_simulator --generate-config-file [OUTPUT_FILE]
```

where `OUTPUT_FILE` is the path to the output file.

For example: `./bin/chirpstack_simulator --generate-config-file ./bin/chirpstack_simulator.toml`

### Example

```toml
[general]
log_level = 4

[server]
network_server = "localhost:1700"
application_server = "localhost:8080"

[simulator]
jwt_token = ""
service_profile_id = ""
duration = 60
activation_time = 5

[simulator.device]
count = 100
uplink_interval = 10
f_port = 10
payload = "uplink_packet_1234"
frequency = 868100000
bandwidth = 125
spreading_factor = 12

[simulator.gateway]
min_count = 3
max_count = 5

[simulator.client]
enable_downlink_test = false
downlink_interval = 15
payload = "downlink_packet_1234"
```

### Note
* **How to set JWT token:** JWT token can be acquired in the `Token` field after creating a new API key using **ChirpStack Application Server** web-interface.
* **How to set service-profile ID:** Service-profile ID can be acquired in the URL after creating a new service-profile using **ChirpStack Application Server** web-interface.

## Running

### How to run

To start **ChirpStack Simulator**, use the following command:

```bash
./bin/chirpstack_simulator --config [CONFIG_FILE]
```

where `CONFIG_FILE` is the path to the configuration file.

For example: `./bin/chirpstack_simulator --config ./bin/chirpstack_simulator.toml`

### What happens during the simulation

After parsing and validating the configuration parameters, **ChirpStack Simulator** uses the configured `simulator.jwt_token` and `simulator.service_profile_id` to create gateways and devices. Then, the simulation starts.

The simulation will be gracefully stopped after a `simulator.duration` interval. During this interval, devices will periodically send uplink frames (and handle downlink frames, if any) to the configured `server.network_server` through the gateways assigned to them.

If downlink test is enabled, downlink frames will also be sent periodically to the configured `server.application_server` while waiting to stop.

### How to stop

**ChirpStack Simulator** will be terminated by any of the following conditions:

* After a `simulator.duration` interval.
* When an exception is thrown.
* When receiving a SIGINT signal.

When the simulation stops, the gateways and devices created earlier will be deleted.
